Here is where I'll be posting "notes" of varying length that dig into topics in causal inference, machine learning, statistical computation, and other areas I find interesting or useful.



### Overview of Experimental Design
This note provides an overview of experimental design including key principles, basic statistics, parametric hypothesis testing, ANOVA, randomization tests, and factorial designs.  [Link](Notes/Experimental-Design.html)

### Causal Inference Fundamentals
This note provides an overview of foundational ideas in causal inference. I discuss potential outcomes, target causal estimands, the structural causal model, DAGs, Twin Networks, SWIGs, and the adjustment criterion. [Link](Notes/Causal-Inference-Fundamentals.html)

### Data Explotation in R
This note covers how I approach data exploration using tools in R. The focus is on exploring a dataset starting from zero. [Link](Notes/Data-Exploation---R.html)
