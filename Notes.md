Here is where I'll be posting "notes" of varying length that dig into topics in causal inference, machine learning, statistical computation, and other areas I find interesting.

<span style="color: red;"> These are incomplete and include reminders to myself and callouts for items to be filled in. Hopefully they'll become more polished over time!   </span>




### Overview of Experimental Design
This note provides an overview of experimental design including key principles, basic statistics, parametric hypothesis testing, ANOVA, randomization tests, and factorial designs.  [Link](Notes/Experimental-Design.html) 

--- 

### Overview of Observational Causal Inference
This note covers why observational causal inference is important, potential outcomes, identification and estimation strategies.  [Link](Notes/Causal-Inference.html) 

--- 

### The Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
We discuss the potential outcomes framework from first principles. We discuss how this framework thinks about causality, the core problems at issue, assumptions, and causal effects of interest.  [Link](Notes/Potential-Outcomes-Framework--2021-10-13-.html)

### Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
This note takes a look at the mechanics and intuition behind IPW as a method for achieving covariate balance and conditional ignorability. [Link](Notes/IPW--2021-10-13-.html)

### Code Bits
What it sounds like. Bits of code that I've used over the years when I forget syntax and things - organization is not great and there is no formatting. Beware! I try to attribute where things came from (but might fall short in some cases); I do not claim everything to be mine.
