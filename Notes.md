Here is where I'll be posting "notes" of varying length that dig into topics in causal inference, machine learning, statistical computation, and other areas I find interesting.

<span style="color: red;"> These are incomplete and include reminders to myself and callouts for items to be filled in. Hopefully they'll become more polished over time!   </span>


### The Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
We discuss the potential outcomes framework from first principles. We discuss how this framework thinks about causality, the core problems at issue, assumptions, and causal effects of interest.  [Link](Notes/Potential-Outcomes-Framework--2021-10-13-.html)

### Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
This note takes a look at the mechanics and intuition behind IPW as a method for achieving covariate balance and conditional ignorability. [Link](Notes/IPW--2021-10-13-.html)
