### ATP Tennis Match Data Analysis (In Progress)

We’ll explore ATP match level data from 1991 to 2020. The work will include

* Explore the data.
* Cleaning the data and building a database.
* Calculating Elo Ratings.
* Performing simple analyses that I found interesting. There will surely be more of these to come. 
    * Are older players doing better?  
    * How many matches are typically in a player's career and how many years does a typical career last?
    * How many players have been ranked number 1 and how can we visualize which players dominated during different periods of time?
    * How do the results for best-of-three versus best-of-five set matches differ? (In Progress)
    * How does handedness effect matchups? (In Progress)
* Build models for predicting match winner incorporating match and player information, head-to-head statistics, as well as Elo ratings. (In Progress but there is some initial work on this.)
* Build a web app that provides player profiles, match up predictions, match up histories, Elo ratings, other fun things.  (In Progress)

### Screening AlexNet Hyperparameters with MNIST
with Ashley Chiu

We deploy an experimental approach to hyperparameter tuning in the context of AlexNet. We investigate AlexNet’s innovations, amongst other hyperparameters known to influence accuracy, to screen for the most important hyperparameters in an AlexNet-type CNN.

### Rational Bias in Inflation Expectations
with Robert Murphy

Using generalized method of moments, estimated a structural model of the economy to directly test hypotheses about whether inflation expectations respond rationally to food and energy price movements.
