### ATP Tennis Project (In Progress)

We'll explore ATP match level data from 1991 to 2020.

Some of the questions we'll look into include: What is the effect of age on performance and has this changed over time? (Interpertable Models) What are the most important features for identifying variation in performance? (PCA) How well does previous season's preformance determine current season preformance? Do players have "hot" streaks where winning begets more winning? Is there more variance in the results for best-of-three versus best-of-five set matches? (Does the higher ranked player or player who has done better in head-to-head win more frequently?) How important are first serve percentage, break points saved/won, number of aces, average serve speed, ... effect performance? Are big servers better? (Not controlling for other factors; does a big serve usually come at the cost of other elements that make players more successful) Do lefties perfrom better against righties or other lefties? We'll also try to build a model for predictinig match winner. (Using DL, SVM, and/or XGBoost.)

### Screening AlexNet Hyperparameters with MNIST
with Ashley Chiu

We deploy an experimental approach to hyperparameter tuning in the context of AlexNet. We investigate AlexNet’s innovations, amongst other hyperparameters known to influence accuracy, to screen for the most important hyperparameters in an AlexNet-type CNN.

### Rational Bias in Inflation Expectations
with Robert Murphy

Using generalized method of moments, estimated a structural model of the economy to directly test hypotheses about whether inflation expectations respond rationally to food and energy price movements.
