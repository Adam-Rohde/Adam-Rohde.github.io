### ATP Tennis Match Data Analysis (In Progress)

We’ll explore ATP match level data from 1991 to 2020. The work will include

* Explore the data.
* Cleaning the data and building a database.
* Calculating Elo Ratings.
* Performing simple analyses: Are older players doing better? What are the most important statistics for winning? How well does previous season’s preformance determine current season preformance? How do the results for best-of-three versus best-of-five set matches differ? How does handedness effect matchups?
    * Right now olny the first of these has been explored.
* Build models for predicting match winner incorporating player and head-to-head statistics as well as Elo ratings.
    * In process.
* Build a web app that provides player profiles, match up predictions, match up histories, Elo ratings, other fun things.  
    * In process.

### Screening AlexNet Hyperparameters with MNIST
with Ashley Chiu

We deploy an experimental approach to hyperparameter tuning in the context of AlexNet. We investigate AlexNet’s innovations, amongst other hyperparameters known to influence accuracy, to screen for the most important hyperparameters in an AlexNet-type CNN.
