### About Me

I’m a PhD student in [Statistics at UCLA](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) working with [Chad Hazlett](https://www.chadhazlett.com/). I spent the summer of 2022 as an Engineering Intern on Twitter's ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (META) team. I have been at UCLA since fall 2019 and plan to graduate in 2023.

**PhD Research:** Questions concerning causal relationships are at the core of science and decision making in policy, business, and technology. However, making credible inferences about causal relationships remains difficult. An under appreciated potential threat to the validity of causal claims is sample selection: how units of study in a data set were selected to be in that data set. My research aims to elucidate what is required to make reliable causal inferences in selected samples. I focus on the problem of sample selection as pertains to understanding causal relationships in the sample at hand. Credible estimates of causal effects for the selected sample are called internally valid. I have developed graphical tools that aid researchers in determining whether sample selection has biased causal inferences. These tools also demonstrate whether such bias can be overcome. In addition, my work incorporates these graphical tools into common observational and quasi‑experimental research designs such as instrumental variables. My work also includes sensitivity analyses focused on how sample selection can violate important causal assumptions and change the inferences we are able to make. 



**Background:** Before UCLA, I worked at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/) for 6 years conducting econometric investigations related to mergers, acquisitions, market dynamics, and antitrust litigation. It was here that my interest in the intersection of data, causality, and credible inference caught fire. Much of my work focused in the healthcare space, but spanned a variety of industries. I have expertise working with large databases (up to a few terabytes) to draw insights for clients and understand markets using a variety of data science, statistical, and econometric tools and methods. 
<!--Over the course of the prior six years at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/), my work focused on data science related to mergers, acquisitions, and antitrust litigation. This consisted of designing and conducting empirical analyses of market dynamics in a variety of industries. Working with [Sandra Chan](http://www.crai.com/expert/sandra-chan) among others, much of my work was in the healthcare space. My responsibilities included exploring, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing large client datasets (e.g., shipment data, transaction data, claims data, prescription data) to understand competition, pricing, and client operations. Analyses included modeling prices, demand, willingness-to-pay, market share, market size, and other key factors to estimate effects of anticompetitive acts, potential mergers, and prevailing market conditions. -->

I did my undergrad at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), where I studied, separately, pure mathematics and economics. I did econometric research with [Bob Murphy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/economics/people/faculty-directory/robert-murphy.html) related to whether inflation expectations respond rationally to food and energy price movements. This work was presented at the 2015 AEA Meetings in Boston and published in the [Eastern Economic Journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Feej.2015.50).

I grew up in Minnesota, lived in Boston for eight years, spent two years in Berkeley and Oakland, and moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2019.
