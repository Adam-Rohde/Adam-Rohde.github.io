### About Me

I’m a PhD student in [Statistics at UCLA](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) working with [Chad Hazlett](https://www.chadhazlett.com/). I spent the summer of 2022 as an Engineering Intern on Twitter's ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (META) team. I have been at UCLA since fall 2019 and plan to graduate in 2023.

My PhD work focuses on building tools that practitioners can use to solve real-world problems using credible causal inference, with possible applications in science, policy, business, and technology. My work has focused on the underappreciated issue of sample selection (how units observed in a data set were selected to be in that data set) for internal validity and how to leverage information from placebo outcomes and treatments. The methods I have developed include a graphical procedure for evaluating sample selection as a threat to internal validity, a sensitivity analysis for sample selection, and a flexible and powerful partial identification framework for leveraging information about placebo outcomes and treatments to make defensible causal claims. 

Before UCLA, I worked at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/) for 6 years conducting econometric investigations related to mergers, acquisitions, market dynamics, and antitrust litigation. Much of my work focused in the healthcare space, but spanned a variety of industries. I have expertise working with large databases to draw insights for clients and understand markets using a variety of data science, statistical, and econometric tools and methods. 
<!--Over the course of the prior six years at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/), my work focused on data science related to mergers, acquisitions, and antitrust litigation. This consisted of designing and conducting empirical analyses of market dynamics in a variety of industries. Working with [Sandra Chan](http://www.crai.com/expert/sandra-chan) among others, much of my work was in the healthcare space. My responsibilities included exploring, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing large client datasets (e.g., shipment data, transaction data, claims data, prescription data) to understand competition, pricing, and client operations. Analyses included modeling prices, demand, willingness-to-pay, market share, market size, and other key factors to estimate effects of anticompetitive acts, potential mergers, and prevailing market conditions. -->

I did my undergrad at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), where I studied pure mathematics and economics. I did econometric research with [Bob Murphy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/economics/people/faculty-directory/robert-murphy.html) related to whether inflation expectations respond rationally to food and energy price movements. See this [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Feej.2015.50).

I grew up in Minnesota, lived in Boston for eight years, spent two years in Berkeley and Oakland, and moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2019.
