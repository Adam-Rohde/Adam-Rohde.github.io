### About Me

I’m a PhD student in [Statistics at UCLA](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) working with [Chad Hazlett](https://www.chadhazlett.com/). My research focuses on developing theory and methods in causal inference focused on sample selection bias, sensitivity analysis, and novel identification strategies. I am also interested in how machine learning approaches can be used in causal inference and how causality can be introduced into machine learning. 

Before UCLA, I worked at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/) for 6 years conducting empirical analyses related to mergers, acquisitions, market dynamics, and antitrust litigation. Much of my work focused in the healthcare space, but spanned a variety of industries. I built expertise in working with large databases (up to a few terabytes) to draw insights for clients and understand markets using a variety of data science, statistical, and econometric tools and methods. 
<!--Over the course of the prior six years at [Charles River Associates](http://www.crai.com/), my work focused on data science related to mergers, acquisitions, and antitrust litigation. This consisted of designing and conducting empirical analyses of market dynamics in a variety of industries. Working with [Sandra Chan](http://www.crai.com/expert/sandra-chan) among others, much of my work was in the healthcare space. My responsibilities included exploring, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing large client datasets (e.g., shipment data, transaction data, claims data, prescription data) to understand competition, pricing, and client operations. Analyses included modeling prices, demand, willingness-to-pay, market share, market size, and other key factors to estimate effects of anticompetitive acts, potential mergers, and prevailing market conditions. -->

I did my undergrad at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), where I studied Mathematics and Economics. There I did research with [Bob Murphy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/economics/people/faculty-directory/robert-murphy.html) related to whether inflation expectations respond rationally to food and energy price movements. This work was presented at the 2015 AEA Meetings in Boston and published in the [Eastern Economic Journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Feej.2015.50).

I grew up in Minnesota, lived in Boston for eight years, spent two years in Berkeley and Oakland, and moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2019.
